# autoupdaterexample
A Visual C# Autoupdater example.

This example covers basic using of C#'s WebClient class through downloading strings and files by creating a simple but functional (semi)auto-updating client.

This method is not secure as it is vulnerable to manipulation of code, man in the middle packet interception and much more.
